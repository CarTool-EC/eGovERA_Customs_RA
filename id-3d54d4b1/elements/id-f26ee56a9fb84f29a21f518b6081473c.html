This could involve the use of advanced software, hardware, or digital tools to carry out tasks that are specific to the business or industry. These special procedures could include proprietary algorithms, unique data analysis methods, specialized manufacturing processes, or any other digital processes that give the business a competitive advantage. This capability is crucial in today's digital age as it allows businesses to differentiate themselves from competitors and deliver unique value to customers.

Additional information: The 'Special Procedure' Digital Business Capability refers to the ability of an organization to execute unique, non-standard processes or operations that are critical to its business model or strategy, leveraging digital technologies. This capability is not about routine, everyday operations but rather about specific procedures that are unique to the organization or its industry.

These special procedures could include anything from complex data analysis, proprietary manufacturing processes, unique service delivery methods, specialized regulatory compliance activities, to innovative customer engagement techniques. They are often the result of an organization's unique expertise, intellectual property, or strategic focus.

The digital aspect of this capability refers to the use of digital technologies to enable, enhance, automate, or transform these special procedures. This could involve the use of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, IoT, blockchain, or other emerging technologies.

The 'Special Procedure' Digital Business Capability requires an organization to have the necessary digital infrastructure, skills, and culture. It also requires a deep understanding of the organization's unique processes and the ability to leverage technology to optimize these processes. This capability can provide a significant competitive advantage, enabling an organization to perform unique procedures more effectively, efficiently, or innovatively than its competitors. 

In the context of TOGAF, this capability would be part of the organization's overall enterprise architecture, aligning with its business strategy and objectives, and would need to be carefully managed, governed, and evolved over time.

Example: 1. Online Tax Filing: Many public sector organizations such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States have implemented digital business capabilities to allow citizens to file their taxes online. This special procedure involves secure data transmission, automatic calculation of tax obligations, and instant submission of tax forms.

2. Digital Voting: Some countries are experimenting with digital voting systems to increase voter participation and reduce the cost of elections. This involves secure online platforms where citizens can cast their votes, which are then automatically tallied and verified.

3. E-Health Records: Public health organizations are increasingly using digital systems to manage patient records. This involves secure databases where patient information is stored and can be accessed by authorized healthcare professionals. 

4. Online License Renewal: Many departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) offer online services for renewing driver's licenses and vehicle registrations. This involves secure online payment systems and automatic updating of DMV records.

5. E-Learning Platforms: Public education institutions are increasingly using digital platforms to deliver courses and educational materials. This involves online learning management systems where students can access course materials, submit assignments, and communicate with teachers.

6. Digital Public Procurement: Governments are implementing digital platforms to manage public procurement processes. This involves online systems where suppliers can submit bids, and public officials can evaluate and award contracts.

7. Online Immigration Services: Immigration departments are offering online services for visa applications and renewals. This involves secure online forms and payment systems, as well as digital systems for tracking application status. 

8. E-Government Portals: Many governments have implemented comprehensive e-government portals that provide a wide range of public services online. These portals often involve complex digital systems that integrate various government departments and services.
