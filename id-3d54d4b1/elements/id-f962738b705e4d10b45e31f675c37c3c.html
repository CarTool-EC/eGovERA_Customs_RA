This includes the use of digital platforms for real-time information sharing, tracking, and communication to ensure efficient handling and delivery of parcels. It also involves the use of digital systems for customs declaration, duties and taxes calculation, and compliance with international trade regulations. This capability enhances the speed and accuracy of customs clearance processes, improves service delivery, and promotes regulatory compliance.

Additional information: The 'Cooperation between Customs and Postal Operators' Digital Business Capability refers to the ability of a business, specifically within the customs and postal sectors, to effectively collaborate and coordinate their operations through digital means. This capability encompasses a wide range of activities and processes, all of which are facilitated by digital technologies.

At its core, this capability involves the use of digital systems and platforms to streamline and enhance the exchange of information and data between customs and postal operators. This could include, for example, the use of digital platforms for sharing information about incoming and outgoing shipments, tracking parcels, managing customs declarations, and coordinating delivery schedules.

Furthermore, this capability also includes the ability to leverage digital technologies to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, customs and postal operators might use digital tools to automate certain processes, such as the sorting and scanning of parcels, thereby reducing manual labor and minimizing errors.

In addition, this capability also involves the ability to use digital technologies to enhance communication and collaboration between customs and postal operators. This could involve the use of digital communication tools, such as email, instant messaging, and video conferencing, to facilitate real-time communication and collaboration.

Moreover, this capability also includes the ability to leverage digital technologies to improve compliance with customs regulations. For instance, digital systems could be used to automatically check parcels against customs databases, thereby ensuring that all shipments comply with relevant laws and regulations.

Finally, this capability also involves the ability to use digital technologies to improve customer service. For instance, digital systems could be used to provide customers with real-time tracking information, thereby enhancing transparency and improving customer satisfaction.

In summary, the 'Cooperation between Customs and Postal Operators' Digital Business Capability involves the use of digital technologies to enhance collaboration and coordination between customs and postal operators, improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, enhance compliance with customs regulations, and improve customer service.

Example: 1. Cross-Border E-Commerce Program: In the United States, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the United States Postal Service (USPS) have collaborated to streamline the process of inspecting and clearing international mail. This cooperation has resulted in the development of a digital platform that allows for real-time data exchange, improving the speed and accuracy of customs clearance.

2. Electronic Advance Data (EAD): The Universal Postal Union (UPU) has developed a system that allows postal operators to share advance electronic data with customs authorities. This data includes information about the sender, recipient, and contents of the parcel, which helps customs authorities to assess the risk level of the parcel and decide whether it needs to be inspected.

3. Integrated Border Management System: In the European Union, customs and postal operators work together under the Integrated Border Management System. This system uses digital technologies to facilitate the exchange of information and cooperation between different border control agencies, including customs and postal services.

4. Digital Customs Declaration: In many countries, postal operators have introduced digital customs declaration forms that customers can fill out online. This not only speeds up the process for customers but also allows customs authorities to process and clear parcels more quickly and efficiently.

5. Track and Trace Systems: Many postal operators have developed digital track and trace systems that allow customers to follow the progress of their parcels in real time. These systems also provide customs authorities with valuable data that can be used to improve their risk assessment and inspection processes. 

6. E-Customs Partnership in China: China Customs has partnered with China Post to establish an e-customs clearance system for cross-border e-commerce. The system allows for the electronic submission of customs declarations and the real-time tracking of parcels, improving the efficiency and transparency of the customs clearance process.
