These transactions are subject to specific VAT regulations and reporting requirements.

Additional information: Intra-EU purchases and sales are a key aspect of doing business within the European Union. They involve the exchange of goods and services between businesses located in different EU member states. These transactions are subject to specific VAT regulations and reporting requirements. For example, the seller must report the sale in an EC Sales List (ESL), while the buyer must report the purchase in their VAT return. The VAT rate applied depends on the type of goods or services sold, and the specific VAT regulations of the buyer's country. It's important for businesses to accurately track and report these transactions to comply with EU tax laws.

Example: For instance, a company based in Germany selling machinery to a company in France would need to report this as an intra-EU sale. The German company would list the sale in their ESL and would not charge VAT, while the French company would report the purchase in their VAT return and apply the reverse charge mechanism, effectively paying the VAT in France. Another example could be a software company in Ireland providing services to a company in Spain. The Irish company would report the sale in their ESL and would not charge VAT, while the Spanish company would report the purchase in their VAT return and apply the reverse charge mechanism.
