This system was established to improve the security of international trade, streamline customs procedures, and facilitate data exchange between operators and customs. The EORI number is used in all communications with any EU customs authorities, for customs declarations and customs clearance for both import and export shipments.

Additional information: The Economic Operators Registration and Identification number (EORI) is a unique identification number that businesses and individuals involved in importing or exporting goods within the European Union are required to use in their communications with customs authorities. It is a critical component of the EU's system for tracking and managing trade within its borders.

The EORI number is assigned by the customs authority of the country where the economic operator is established, and it is valid throughout the European Union. It is used in all communications with customs authorities, regardless of the country within the EU where the goods are being imported or exported.

The EORI number is designed to facilitate efficient and secure data exchange between operators and customs, thus ensuring transparency and traceability of customs procedures. It is used in various customs procedures and processes, such as customs declarations, customs decisions, and customs simplifications.

The EORI system is part of the EU's broader strategy to modernize customs procedures, improve security, and facilitate trade. It is a key element of the EU's electronic customs initiative, which aims to streamline and digitize customs procedures across the EU.

The EORI number is composed of a country code (representing the country that issued the EORI number), followed by a code or number that is unique within the country. The structure and length of the unique code or number can vary from one country to another.

In summary, the EORI number is a crucial identifier used in the EU's customs procedures, facilitating the efficient and secure exchange of data between economic operators and customs authorities.

It helps in the identification of the traders and simplifies the customs process. It is also used in the declaration of goods, ensuring compliance with customs regulations.

3. Freight Forwarders: Freight forwarders and logistics companies use the EORI number to clear goods through customs on behalf of their clients. It helps in the identification of the operator and expedites the customs clearance process.

4. Manufacturing Companies: Manufacturing companies that import raw materials or export finished goods within the European Union use the EORI number. It helps in the tracking of goods and ensures a smooth customs process.

5. Tax Authorities: Tax authorities use the EORI number to identify traders and track the movement of goods. It helps in the enforcement of tax laws and ensures compliance with customs regulations.

6. Supply Chain Management: In supply chain management, the EORI number is used to track the movement of goods across borders. It helps in the efficient management of the supply chain and ensures the timely delivery of goods.
