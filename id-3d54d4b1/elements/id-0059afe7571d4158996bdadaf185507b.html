Additional information: The Customs Legislation on Governance Interoperability (NBI) is a catalogue of elements that includes national legal acts on customs cooperation with private businesses and between different member states. These elements provide the legal basis for customs operations and cooperation, aiming to ensure smooth and efficient customs processes. The first element pertains to the legal framework for cooperation between customs authorities and private businesses, while the second element refers to the legal framework for cooperation between customs authorities of different member states. These elements are crucial for ensuring interoperability in customs governance, which is key for facilitating international trade and ensuring compliance with customs regulations.

Example: An example of the application of the 'National legal act on custom cooperation with private businesses' could be a legislation that outlines the responsibilities and obligations of private businesses in customs processes, such as the declaration of goods for import or export. An example of the 'National legal act on custom cooperation between different member states' could be an agreement between two countries to share information and collaborate on customs enforcement to prevent smuggling and fraud.
