						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Definition: Cooperation between Customs laboratories involves the implementation of digital platforms and systems to facilitate seamless collaboration, information sharing, and data exchange between customs laboratories. This service enables the efficient management and coordination of laboratory testing, sample analysis, and the exchange of scientific data and results. By leveraging digital technologies, such as laboratory information management systems (LIMS) and secure data-sharing protocols, the cooperation between Customs laboratories enhances the interoperability of laboratory operations, improves data accuracy and consistency, and fosters scientific collaboration within the customs environment. This digital solution service promotes the sharing of best practices, harmonization of testing methods, and efficient utilization of resources, ultimately contributing to robust customs control, compliance verification, and trade facilitation.

Source: Based on World Customs Organization (WCO)

Example: In a collaborative effort, Customs authorities of multiple countries have implemented a digital solution to enhance cooperation and information sharing between their respective customs laboratories. The digital platform provides a secure and standardized framework for exchanging scientific data, analysis results, and testing methodologies. Customs laboratories can efficiently share their expertise, harmonize testing methods, and collectively address emerging challenges in areas such as counterfeit detection, hazardous substance analysis, or product safety compliance. The digital solution fosters collaboration, reduces redundant testing efforts, and facilitates the timely sharing of scientific insights, leading to more effective customs control, improved compliance verification, and enhanced trade facilitation across borders.
