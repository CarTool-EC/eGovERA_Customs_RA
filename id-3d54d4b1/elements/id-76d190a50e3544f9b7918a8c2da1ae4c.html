These include special, export, transit, and import procedures, as well as the accreditation of Authorised Economic Operators and compliance requirements checks. These systems are aimed at enhancing trade facilitation, ensuring compliance with customs regulations, and promoting efficient and secure cross-border trade within the customs environment.

Additional information: The elements within the Customs Compliance and Regulatory Requirements Enablers ABB are digital solutions that automate various customs processes such as document verification, risk assessment, and clearance for export and import procedures. They also facilitate electronic communication and data exchange between traders and customs authorities, reducing paperwork, improving accuracy, and expediting procedures. The special procedure element refers to systems managing customs procedures that deviate from standard import/export processes. The transit procedure element refers to systems facilitating the movement of goods under customs control from one customs territory to another. The Authorised Economic Operator accreditation and compliance requirements checks elements, although not described in the provided JSON, likely refer to systems managing the accreditation process for economic operators and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

Example: An example of the application of these elements could be a company using the Export procedure digital solution to electronically submit export declarations and relevant documentation through a centralized online platform. The system would then automate the document verification, risk assessment, and export clearance processes, facilitating electronic communication and data exchange between the company and customs authorities. This would reduce paperwork, improve accuracy, and expedite the export procedure, ensuring compliance with customs regulations and promoting efficient and secure cross-border trade.
