This includes details about the cargo's content, origin, destination, handling requirements, and tracking information. This capability ensures that all relevant data is accurately recorded and preserved in a digital format, allowing for easy access, retrieval, and analysis. It is crucial for operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and providing transparency to customers.

Additional information: The 'Preservation of Cargo Information' digital business capability refers to the ability of a business, specifically within the logistics, shipping, or supply chain industry, to effectively capture, store, manage, and protect all relevant information related to cargo. This includes data about the cargo's nature, quantity, destination, origin, handling requirements, and transportation details.

This capability involves the use of digital technologies and systems to ensure that cargo information is accurately recorded and preserved over time. It may involve the use of databases, cloud storage solutions, and other digital tools to maintain a comprehensive and accessible record of cargo information. 

The capability also includes ensuring the security and integrity of this information, protecting it from loss, damage, unauthorized access, or other threats. This may involve the use of encryption, access controls, backup systems, and other security measures.

Furthermore, the 'Preservation of Cargo Information' capability also implies the ability to retrieve and use this information effectively. This may involve providing access to relevant stakeholders, integrating with other systems for data analysis and decision-making, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards for data management and privacy.

In essence, this capability is crucial for businesses in the logistics and supply chain industry as it enables them to track and manage their cargo effectively, ensure compliance, make informed decisions, and provide a high level of service to their customers.

Example: 1. National Postal Services: Postal services often have digital systems in place to track and preserve information about the cargo they handle. This includes details about the sender, recipient, the type of cargo, its weight, and its journey through the postal system.

2. Customs and Border Protection: In many countries, customs and border protection agencies use digital systems to preserve information about cargo entering and leaving the country. This includes details about the cargo's origin, destination, contents, and value.

3. Public Transport Authorities: Public transport authorities may use digital systems to track and preserve information about cargo transported on public transport networks. This could include details about the cargo's origin, destination, and journey through the network.

4. Public Health Agencies: Public health agencies may use digital systems to preserve information about medical supplies and other cargo. This could include details about the cargo's origin, destination, contents, and storage requirements.

5. Disaster Management Agencies: These agencies often use digital systems to track and preserve information about relief supplies and other cargo. This includes details about the cargo's origin, destination, contents, and the people or areas it is intended to help.

6. Space Agencies: Agencies like NASA use digital systems to preserve information about cargo sent to space. This includes details about the cargo's origin, contents, destination, and journey.

7. Public Libraries: Libraries often use digital systems to track and preserve information about books and other items in their collections, which can be considered a type of cargo.

8. Department of Defense: Military departments use digital systems to track and preserve information about military supplies and equipment, including their origin, destination, contents, and storage requirements.
