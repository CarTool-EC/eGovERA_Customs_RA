These elements include the Registered Exporter system (REX), Economic Operators Registration and Identification number (EORI), Import Control System (ICS), Integrated Tariff of the European Union (TARIC), VAT Information Exchange System (VIES), and the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) status.

Additional information: The Customs Base Registry is a comprehensive catalogue of systems and identifiers used in international trade. The REX system allows for self-certification of goods' origin by registered exporters. The EORI system assigns unique identification numbers to economic operators involved in customs activities within the EU. The ICS is an EU system designed to enhance customs control over goods entering the EU. TARIC is an integrated tariff database that contains information on customs tariffs, import and export formalities, and applicable measures. VIES is a system that enables businesses to verify the validity of VAT numbers of their trading partners within the EU. AEO is a status granted to businesses by customs administrations in the EU and many other countries worldwide, recognizing businesses that meet certain criteria and demonstrate compliance with customs regulations and security standards.

Example: For example, a business exporting goods from the EU would need to register in the REX system to self-certify the origin of their goods. They would also need an EORI number for identification in customs activities. If they are importing goods into the EU, they would need to submit advanced electronic entry summary declarations through the ICS. They could use TARIC to determine the customs duties and trade policies associated with their products, and VIES to verify the VAT numbers of their trading partners. If they meet certain criteria, they could also apply for AEO status to enhance their supply chain security and facilitate their trade operations.
