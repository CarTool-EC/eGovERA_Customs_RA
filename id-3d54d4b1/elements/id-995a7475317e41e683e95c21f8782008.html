This service involves the implementation of digital systems, such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to enable real-time visibility and management of expeditions. The digital solution provides customs authorities with accurate and timely information on the movement, location, and condition of goods, facilitating efficient risk assessment, inspection prioritization, and trade facilitation. By automating expeditions controls, this service improves supply chain security, reduces transit times, enhances customs compliance, and ensures the smooth flow of goods across borders within the customs environment.

Source: Based on World Customs Organization (WCO)

Example: In the customs department of Country ABC, a digital solution for expeditions controls has been implemented to enhance the monitoring and tracking of goods during transportation. IoT devices are attached to shipments, providing real-time location tracking and environmental condition monitoring. The system integrates with customs databases and utilizes advanced analytics to analyze the data collected from the IoT devices. Customs officers can access a centralized dashboard that displays real-time information on the movement, status, and compliance of goods in transit. By automating expeditions controls, this digital solution improves customs risk assessment capabilities, enables targeted inspections, reduces transit times, and enhances trade facilitation. It enhances supply chain visibility, strengthens security measures, and ensures the efficient and compliant movement of goods across borders in Country ABC.
