						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Description: The 'Authorised Economic Operator accreditation' digital business capability refers to the ability of a business to digitally manage and maintain its status as an Authorised Economic Operator (AEO). This includes the capacity to handle digital applications, certifications, audits, and compliance checks related to AEO accreditation. It also involves the ability to digitally monitor and adhere to the standards and regulations set by customs authorities. This capability ensures that the business can efficiently operate within the international supply chain as a trusted and secure partner, benefiting from advantages in customs procedures.

Additional information: The 'Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) accreditation' Digital Business Capability refers to the ability of a business to leverage digital technologies, systems, and processes to obtain and maintain the AEO status, which is a globally recognized quality mark indicating that the company's role in the international supply chain is secure and their customs controls and procedures are efficient and compliant.

This capability involves the use of digital tools and platforms to manage and streamline the application process for AEO status, including the submission of necessary documentation and evidence to customs authorities. It also includes the ability to digitally monitor and ensure ongoing compliance with AEO requirements, such as maintaining appropriate records, demonstrating financial solvency, and implementing effective security and management systems.

Moreover, this capability extends to the ability to use digital technologies to enhance the benefits of AEO status. This could include integrating with customs IT systems for faster and more efficient customs procedures, leveraging data analytics to identify opportunities for further supply chain optimization, and using digital communication tools to demonstrate AEO status to customers, partners, and stakeholders.

In essence, the 'Authorised Economic Operator accreditation' Digital Business Capability is about using digital technologies to facilitate the attainment and exploitation of AEO status, thereby enhancing the business's competitiveness and performance in the global trade environment.

Example: 1. Customs and Border Protection (CBP): In the United States, the CBP uses the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) accreditation as a part of their Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program. This digital business capability allows them to streamline and secure international trade, reducing the risk of illegal or unsafe goods entering the country.

2. European Union (EU): The EU has a comprehensive AEO system that allows businesses to be recognized as secure and reliable, facilitating faster processing of shipments and fewer customs controls. This digital business capability is used by the public sector to enhance trade efficiency and security across the EU.

3. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC): In the UK, HMRC uses the AEO accreditation as part of their strategy to secure and facilitate global trade. This digital business capability allows them to provide businesses with benefits such as lower risk scores and priority treatment during customs controls.

4. Australian Border Force (ABF): The ABF uses the AEO accreditation as part of their Trusted Trader program. This digital business capability allows them to provide businesses with trade facilitation benefits, such as faster clearance times and reduced examination rates.

5. Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA): The CBSA uses the AEO accreditation as part of their Partners in Protection (PIP) program. This digital business capability allows them to work with businesses to secure the trade chain and facilitate the movement of legitimate goods.
