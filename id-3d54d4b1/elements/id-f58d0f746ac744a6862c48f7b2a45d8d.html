These forms include Hybrid Blockchain Governance, Public Blockchain Governance (permissionless), Private Blockchain Governance (permissioned), and Blockchain Governance in general.

Additional information: The Business Agnostic Technical Governance Catalogue is a comprehensive collection of different types of blockchain governance. It includes Hybrid Blockchain Governance, which combines aspects of both public and private blockchains. Public Blockchain Governance (permissionless) is a type of blockchain where anyone can join and participate in the decision-making process. Private Blockchain Governance (permissioned) is a type of blockchain where only selected entities are allowed to participate in the consensus process. Lastly, Blockchain Governance in general refers to the system of rules and procedures that regulate the operation and maintenance of a blockchain network.

Example: An example of Hybrid Blockchain Governance is the Ripple network, which combines aspects of both public and private blockchains. It allows certain nodes to participate in the consensus process, while also allowing anyone to hold and transfer its native cryptocurrency, XRP.
Bitcoin is a prime example of Public Blockchain Governance (permissionless). Anyone can join the network, participate in the mining process, and have a say in the decision-making process.
An example of Private Blockchain Governance (permissioned) is the Hyperledger Fabric, where only selected entities are allowed to participate in the consensus process.
Ethereum is an example of Blockchain Governance. It has a system of rules and procedures that regulate the operation and maintenance of the network, including the process of decision-making and the implementation of changes to the protocol.
