This includes the use of software and systems for tasks such as scheduling and tracking experiments, managing and analyzing data, maintaining quality control, ensuring regulatory compliance, and managing resources and inventory. It also involves the use of digital tools for communication and collaboration within the laboratory environment. This capability is crucial for improving efficiency, accuracy, and productivity in laboratory operations.

Additional information: The 'Laboratories Management' digital business capability refers to the ability of an organization to effectively manage and control its laboratory operations using digital technologies. This capability encompasses a wide range of activities and processes, including but not limited to, the management of laboratory equipment, materials, and resources, the scheduling and execution of laboratory tests and experiments, the collection, analysis, and reporting of laboratory data, and the compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

In a more detailed perspective, this capability involves the use of digital systems and tools to automate and streamline laboratory processes, improve the accuracy and reliability of laboratory results, enhance the efficiency and productivity of laboratory personnel, and ensure the safety and security of laboratory facilities. It also involves the integration of laboratory systems with other business systems to facilitate the sharing and utilization of laboratory data across the organization.

Moreover, the 'Laboratories Management' digital business capability also includes the ability to leverage advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics to drive innovation and improvement in laboratory operations. This could involve the use of predictive analytics to optimize laboratory workflows, the application of machine learning algorithms to automate complex laboratory tasks, or the use of AI-powered tools to enhance the quality and speed of laboratory decision-making.

Furthermore, this capability also entails the ability to manage the digital transformation of laboratory operations, including the planning, implementation, and management of digital laboratory projects, the training and development of laboratory personnel in the use of digital technologies, and the management of the risks and challenges associated with digital transformation.

In essence, the 'Laboratories Management' digital business capability is about harnessing the power of digital technologies to enhance the performance and value of laboratory operations, and to enable the organization to achieve its strategic objectives in a digital business environment.

Example: 1. National Institute of Health (NIH): The NIH, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the nation's medical research agency. They use digital capabilities to manage their laboratories, including software for tracking and managing lab equipment, samples, and results, as well as for coordinating research efforts across multiple labs.

2. European Space Agency (ESA): The ESA uses digital capabilities to manage their laboratories, which are involved in a wide range of research and development activities. This includes software for managing lab resources, coordinating research activities, and analyzing and sharing research data.

3. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): The CDC uses digital capabilities to manage their laboratories, which are involved in research and testing related to public health issues. This includes software for managing lab resources, tracking and analyzing test results, and coordinating research efforts.

4. Public Health England (PHE): PHE uses digital capabilities to manage their laboratories, which are involved in research and testing related to public health issues. This includes software for managing lab resources, tracking and analyzing test results, and coordinating research efforts.

5. Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO): ANSTO uses digital capabilities to manage their laboratories, which are involved in nuclear science and technology research. This includes software for managing lab resources, coordinating research activities, and analyzing and sharing research data.

6. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): NOAA uses digital capabilities to manage their laboratories, which are involved in research related to climate, weather, and ocean conditions. This includes software for managing lab resources, tracking and analyzing research data, and coordinating research efforts.
