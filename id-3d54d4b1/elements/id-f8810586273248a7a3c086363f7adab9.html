This service involves the digital capture, storage, and retrieval of cargo-related information, such as shipping details, transport documents, customs declarations, and inspection reports. By leveraging digital technologies, including data management systems, document repositories, and secure data transmission protocols, the preservation of cargo information ensures the integrity, traceability, and accessibility of critical data throughout the customs clearance process. This service enhances data visibility, facilitates compliance verification, and supports efficient customs operations by providing a centralized, organized, and secure repository for cargo-related information.

Source: Based on World Customs Organization (WCO)

Example: A global logistics company, ABC Logistics, involved in international trade. To comply with customs requirements and streamline their operations, they implement a digital solution for the preservation of cargo information. When receiving a shipment, they capture relevant data such as product descriptions, quantities, and associated documents using barcode scanning. This information is securely stored in a centralized cloud-based system, ensuring easy access and preservation. Customs-related documents like bills of lading and packing lists are organized, version-controlled, and readily available for customs inspections. The digital solution enables secure data transmission to customs authorities, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. ABC Logistics benefits from reduced paperwork, increased data accuracy, improved customs compliance, and efficient information retrieval during audits. The preservation of cargo information digital solution enhances their customs operations, ensuring seamless access to critical cargo data and facilitating smooth trade transactions.
