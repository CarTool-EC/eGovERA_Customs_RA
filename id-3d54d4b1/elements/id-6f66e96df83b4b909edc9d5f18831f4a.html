						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Definition: An online platform that provides a centralized and user-friendly interface for traders, customs authorities, and other stakeholders to access and exchange trade-related information and services. This portal offers functionalities such as electronic submission of trade documents, real-time tracking of shipments, automated customs processes, online payment options, and access to relevant trade regulations and guidelines. By leveraging digital technologies, the Trade Facilitation Portal enhances transparency, simplifies procedures, reduces paperwork, and promotes efficiency in cross-border trade, fostering collaboration and communication between traders and customs authorities, ultimately facilitating smoother and faster trade transactions within the customs environment.

Source: Based on World Customs Organization (WCO)

Example: Country ABC has implemented a Trade Facilitation Portal as a digital solution to streamline trade processes and enhance collaboration between traders and customs authorities. The portal provides a user-friendly interface where traders can electronically submit trade documents, such as import/export declarations, certificates of origin, and invoices. Customs authorities can efficiently process and review the submitted documents, reducing paperwork and manual interventions. The portal also enables real-time tracking of shipments, allowing traders to monitor the status and location of their goods. It provides access to up-to-date trade regulations, guidelines, and customs procedures, ensuring compliance and facilitating self-service by traders. Online payment options are integrated into the portal, enabling secure and convenient settlement of customs duties and fees. This Trade Facilitation Portal improves transparency, expedites customs processes, and fosters collaboration and efficiency in cross-border trade, benefiting both traders and customs authorities in Country ABC.
