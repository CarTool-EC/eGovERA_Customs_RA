This includes the use of digital technologies to facilitate communication, collaboration, and information exchange between customs authorities, businesses, and other stakeholders. It also involves leveraging digital tools and platforms to enhance customs procedures, such as the submission and processing of customs declarations, payment of duties and taxes, and compliance with customs regulations. This capability can help businesses to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance in their international trade activities.

Additional information: 'Customs Cooperation' Digital Business Capability refers to the ability of a business to effectively manage, coordinate, and collaborate with customs authorities and other relevant entities through digital means. This capability involves the use of digital technologies to facilitate seamless and efficient customs procedures, compliance with customs regulations, and cross-border trade activities.

This capability encompasses several key elements:

1. Digital Communication: This involves the use of digital platforms for real-time communication and information exchange with customs authorities, trade partners, and other stakeholders. This could include the use of emails, instant messaging, video conferencing, and other digital communication tools.

2. Electronic Documentation: This refers to the ability to create, manage, and submit electronic documents required for customs procedures, such as customs declarations, invoices, and certificates of origin. This helps to reduce paperwork, streamline processes, and improve accuracy and efficiency.

3. Data Integration: This involves the integration of customs data with other business systems and processes. This could include the integration of customs data with supply chain management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and other business applications.

4. Compliance Management: This refers to the ability to ensure compliance with customs regulations and requirements. This could involve the use of digital tools for tracking and managing customs duties and taxes, ensuring accurate classification of goods, and managing customs audits and inspections.

5. Analytics and Reporting: This involves the use of digital analytics tools to monitor and analyze customs data, generate insights, and support decision-making. This could include the use of dashboards, data visualization tools, and reporting systems.

6. Automation: This refers to the use of digital technologies to automate customs processes, such as the automatic calculation of customs duties and taxes, the automatic submission of customs declarations, and the automatic generation of customs reports.

7. Collaboration: This involves the use of digital platforms for collaboration with customs authorities, trade partners, and other stakeholders. This could include the use of collaborative workspaces, project management tools, and social networking platforms.

By developing and enhancing these digital capabilities, businesses can improve their customs operations, reduce costs, increase efficiency, and enhance compliance with customs regulations.

Example: 1. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the United States: CBP uses advanced digital capabilities to facilitate trade and customs cooperation. They use Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), a web-based portal for the collection, processing, and distribution of information related to imported goods. This system allows CBP to effectively manage risk, accelerate the flow of legitimate shipments, and target illicit goods.

2. European Union's Customs Information System (CIS): CIS is a computerized system that allows rapid information exchange between customs authorities within the EU. It helps in preventing, investigating, and prosecuting serious breaches of national laws relating to customs and agricultural matters.

3. Australian Border Force's Integrated Cargo System (ICS): ICS is a web-based system that manages the reporting and clearance of imported and exported goods. It allows for efficient customs cooperation and ensures compliance with Australia's customs and border protection laws.

4. Singapore's Networked Trade Platform (NTP): NTP is a national trade information management platform that provides a single point of access for the trade community. It enables digitalization and seamless data flow, enhancing customs cooperation and efficiency.

5. Canada Border Services Agency's (CBSA) Assessment and Revenue Management (CARM) project: CARM is a multi-year initiative that will transform the collection of duties and taxes for goods imported into Canada. By modernizing and streamlining processes, CARM will provide a more efficient, user-friendly service for the trade community.

6. China Customs' Single Window System: This digital platform integrates and streamlines customs procedures, allowing for efficient data exchange between traders and customs authorities. It enhances customs cooperation and promotes trade facilitation.
