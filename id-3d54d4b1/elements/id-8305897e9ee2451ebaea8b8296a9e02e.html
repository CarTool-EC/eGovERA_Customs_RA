It includes elements such as the EU Customs Data Model (EUCDM) and the WCO Data Model (DM), both of which are designed to facilitate interoperability between different customs systems and stakeholders, promote data consistency, simplify data integration, and support the automation of customs procedures.

Additional information: The Customs Data Model is crucial in the global trade sector, providing a universal language for cross-border data exchange. The EUCDM, developed by the European Union, defines the structure and semantics of customs-related data elements, allowing for consistent and efficient sharing of information, such as import/export declarations, transit data, and customs processes. On the other hand, the WCO Data Model has been the data foundation for global trade interoperability for over two decades. It is a compilation of clearly structured, harmonized, standardized, and reusable sets of data definitions and electronic messages designed to meet the operational and legal requirements of Customs and other cross-border regulatory agencies (CBRAs) responsible for border management. It leverages standards established by international organizations such as the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) and the International Organization of Standards (ISO) to ensure global interoperability.

Example: For instance, when a company in the EU wants to export goods to another country, it would use the EUCDM to structure its export declaration data. This ensures that the data is consistent and can be easily understood by the customs authorities in the destination country. Similarly, a company in a WCO member country would use the WCO Data Model to structure its import declaration data, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the customs authorities in the importing country.
