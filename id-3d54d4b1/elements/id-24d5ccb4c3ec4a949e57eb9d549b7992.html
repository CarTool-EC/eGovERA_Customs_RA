This service enables the automation of customs procedures, such as electronic customs declarations, risk assessment, and customs clearance for postal shipments. It allows customs and postal operators to exchange shipment data, track packages in real-time, and share relevant information electronically. By leveraging digital technologies, such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and data analytics, the cooperation between customs and postal operators enhances efficiency, transparency, and security in cross-border postal operations. This digital solution service promotes trade facilitation, ensures compliance with customs regulations, and expedites the clearance and delivery of postal shipments within the customs environment.
