This system ensures that all goods entering or leaving the EU are classified consistently and in accordance with the Combined Nomenclature, which is the EU's system for designating and coding products. The BTI provides certainty to traders about the tariffs that will be applied to their goods, and it is valid for three years from the date of issue.

Additional information: Binding Tariff Information (BTI) is a system that provides economic operators with legal certainty regarding the tariff classification of their goods. It is a written decision given by the customs authorities of the European Union (EU) member states, upon request, on the classification of goods in the Combined Nomenclature (CN). 

The BTI decision is legally binding on all EU customs authorities and on the holder of the decision for three years from the date of issuance. It ensures the uniform application of the customs rules throughout the EU and provides predictability for businesses in terms of import duties, other charges, and restrictions or prohibitions that may apply. 

The BTI system is governed by the Union Customs Code (UCC), which sets out the legal framework for customs operations in the EU. The UCC provides that a BTI decision may be requested by any person who is either established in the customs territory of the Union or intends to use a BTI decision in relation to customs legislation.

The BTI decision includes information such as a description of the goods, their classification in the CN, and any additional information necessary for their identification. The decision is issued after a technical and scientific analysis of the goods, which may involve laboratory tests, expert opinions, or reference to international standards.

The BTI system is managed by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union (DG TAXUD), which maintains a database of all BTI decisions issued by the EU member states. This database, known as the European Binding Tariff Information system (EBTI), is accessible to the public and allows for the search and retrieval of BTI decisions. 

In the context of information technology, the BTI system and the EBTI database represent key tools for the digitalization and harmonization of customs procedures in the EU. They contribute to the efficiency and transparency of customs operations, facilitate trade, and support the competitiveness of European businesses.

Example: 1. Import/Export Business: A company that imports or exports goods within the European Union can use Binding Tariff Information (BTI) to determine the exact tariffs they will need to pay for specific goods. This can help them accurately calculate their costs and prices, and ensure they are in compliance with all relevant customs regulations.

2. E-commerce: An online retailer selling goods internationally can use BTI to calculate the customs duties that will apply to their products when they are shipped to customers in different EU countries. This can help them provide accurate information to their customers about the total cost of their purchases, including any additional customs duties.

3. Supply Chain Management: A company that sources materials or components from different countries can use BTI to understand the tariffs that will apply to these items. This can help them optimize their supply chain and reduce costs by sourcing from countries with lower tariffs.

4. Legal Compliance: Companies can use BTI to ensure they are in compliance with all relevant customs laws and regulations. This can help them avoid penalties and legal problems.

5. Financial Planning: By using BTI, companies can accurately forecast their future costs and revenues. This can help them make informed decisions about their business strategy and financial planning.

6. Market Research: Companies can use BTI to understand the tariffs that apply to different types of goods in different countries. This can help them identify new markets or products that could be profitable.

7. Logistics and Shipping: Logistics companies can use BTI to calculate the customs duties that will apply to the goods they are transporting. This can help them provide accurate quotes to their customers and ensure they are charging the correct amounts.
