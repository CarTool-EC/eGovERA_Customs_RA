This includes the planning, execution, tracking, and optimization of transit operations using digital technologies. It involves the use of systems and tools for route planning, scheduling, real-time tracking, and analytics to ensure efficient and effective transit procedures. This capability is crucial for businesses in sectors such as logistics, supply chain, transportation, and e-commerce where timely and accurate transit of goods or information is a key operational requirement.

Additional information: The 'Transit Procedure' Digital Business Capability refers to the ability of an organization to manage, control, and execute the process of moving goods, services, or individuals from one location to another through digital means. This capability encompasses a wide range of activities, including the planning, scheduling, tracking, and monitoring of transit operations, as well as the management of related resources, such as vehicles, personnel, and infrastructure.

In a broader sense, this capability also involves the integration and coordination of various other related capabilities, such as supply chain management, logistics, customer service, and risk management. It requires the use of various digital technologies, such as GPS tracking, real-time data analytics, cloud computing, and mobile applications, to ensure efficient and effective transit operations.

The 'Transit Procedure' Digital Business Capability also includes the ability to comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards related to transit operations, such as safety standards, environmental regulations, and customs procedures. It also involves the ability to manage risks and handle unexpected events or disruptions in transit operations.

Furthermore, this capability involves the ability to continuously improve transit operations based on feedback and performance data, as well as the ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions, customer needs, and technological advancements. 

Overall, the 'Transit Procedure' Digital Business Capability is crucial for any organization involved in the transportation or logistics industry, as it directly affects their ability to deliver goods or services to their customers in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner.

Example: 1. Online Transit Fare Payment System: Many public transportation systems now offer online platforms where commuters can pay their transit fares. This digital capability allows users to reload their transit cards, pay for fares, and even plan their routes.

2. Real-Time Transit Tracking: Some public transit systems have implemented real-time tracking capabilities. This allows commuters to see exactly where their bus or train is and when it will arrive at their stop. This capability can significantly improve the user experience by reducing uncertainty and wait times.

3. Digital Transit Scheduling: Digital scheduling tools allow transit authorities to plan and adjust transit routes and schedules based on real-time data. This can help to optimize transit operations and improve service reliability.

4. Mobile Transit Apps: Many cities have developed mobile apps that provide a range of transit-related services. These can include route planning, fare payment, real-time tracking, and even reporting issues or providing feedback.

5. Automated Fare Collection Systems: Automated fare collection systems are a key digital capability in modern public transit. These systems can include ticket vending machines, contactless payment systems, and mobile payment options.

6. Transit Data Analytics: Public transit authorities can use data analytics to gain insights into transit usage patterns, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions. This capability can help to improve service efficiency and effectiveness.

7. Intelligent Traffic Management Systems: These systems use digital technologies to manage traffic flow and reduce congestion. They can include traffic signal control systems, real-time traffic updates, and predictive traffic modeling.

8. Electronic Toll Collection: Highways and bridges often use electronic toll collection systems to automate the process of collecting tolls. These systems can include transponders, license plate recognition technology, and online payment options.
