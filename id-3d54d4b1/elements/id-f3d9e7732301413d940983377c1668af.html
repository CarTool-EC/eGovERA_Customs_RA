This includes understanding and complying with international trade regulations, managing logistics, handling documentation, and ensuring secure and efficient transactions. It also involves the use of digital technologies and platforms to facilitate these processes, such as e-commerce platforms, digital payment systems, and supply chain management software. This capability is crucial for businesses operating in the global market, as it directly impacts their ability to deliver products or services to customers outside their home country.

Additional information: The 'Export Procedure' Digital Business Capability refers to the ability of a business to manage, control, and execute all the necessary processes and operations related to exporting goods or services digitally. This capability encompasses a wide range of activities, including but not limited to:

1. Compliance with International Trade Regulations: This includes understanding and adhering to the various rules, regulations, and laws that govern international trade. It involves ensuring that all export activities are compliant with the export control laws of the home country as well as the import regulations of the destination countries.

2. Documentation and Licensing: This involves the preparation, submission, and management of all necessary export documentation such as export licenses, customs declarations, and shipping documents. It also includes managing digital systems that track and store these documents.

3. Logistics and Supply Chain Management: This includes planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet customers' requirements.

4. Risk Management: This involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating various risks associated with exporting such as financial risks, operational risks, and compliance risks. It also includes managing insurance and claims processes.

5. Customer Service: This involves managing relationships with customers, addressing their queries and concerns, and ensuring their satisfaction with the export process.

6. Financial Management: This includes managing the financial aspects of exporting such as pricing, invoicing, payment collection, currency exchange, and financial reporting.

7. Technology Management: This involves leveraging digital technologies and systems to facilitate and streamline the export process. This could include the use of e-commerce platforms, digital payment systems, blockchain technology for secure and transparent transactions, AI for demand forecasting, and IoT for real-time tracking of goods.

8. Strategic Planning: This involves developing and implementing strategic plans for expanding the business into new markets, improving export operations, and staying competitive in the global market.

This system would ensure that all products being exported meet the necessary health and safety standards of the destination country.

2. Trade Information Portal: A government may have a digital portal that provides all necessary information about export procedures, regulations, tariffs, and trade agreements. This portal would be a one-stop-shop for businesses looking to export goods and services.

3. Customs Declaration System: A digital system used by customs authorities to manage the declaration and clearance of goods for export. This system would streamline the process, reduce paperwork, and increase efficiency.

4. Export Licensing System: In the defense sector, a digital system might be used to manage the issuance of export licenses for defense-related products. This system would ensure compliance with international export control regulations.

5. Digital Export Promotion: A government might use digital marketing strategies and platforms to promote its country's goods and services to potential international buyers. This could include social media campaigns, online trade fairs, and digital advertising.

6. E-Export Documentation: A digital system that allows exporters to submit and manage all necessary export documentation online. This system would reduce the need for physical paperwork and make the export process more efficient.

7. Online Training Platform: A government might offer online training courses on export procedures and regulations. This platform would help businesses understand how to successfully export their goods and services.

8. Export Finance System: A digital system used by a government agency to provide financial support to exporters. This could include loans, insurance, and guarantees to help businesses manage the risks associated with exporting.
